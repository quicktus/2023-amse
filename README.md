# Weather Conditions and Music Preferences

___
**:information_source:** This repository is a student project focused on data engineering and science using open data. It is part of the AMSE/SAKI course, conducted by the [FAU](https://fau.eu/) [Chair for Open-Source Software](https://oss.cs.fau.de/) during the summer semester of 2023.

This project explores the potential connection between music preferences and weather conditions. The analysis indicates that although some associations between music and weather were observed, they were not found to be statistically significant. I speculate that music preferences are influenced by various factors, with the impact of weather being minor.  
Additionally, I use the current weather conditions to attempt to suggest a "weather appropriate" song to the user.  
The analysis is based on data from the [Open Data Server](https://opendata.dwd.de/) of the [German Meteorological Service](https://www.dwd.de/EN/Home/home_node.html) and a [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) dataset of [Daily Song Rankings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pepepython/spotify-huge-database-daily-charts-over-3-years) scraped from [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) as well as additional data points taken directly from Spotify.

**:warning:** This project does not aim to prove a causal relationship. As a matter of fact, the results indicate there is only little correlation in the first place. The analysis is not intended to be scientifically rigorous and should not be construed as such.
